## About ATM Simulator

The "ATM Simulator" project is a model for Bank System Management. It enables the bank's customers to perform various banking tasks and transactions like creating an account with the bank, requesting and accessing various services and facilities offered by the bank, deposit/withdraw cash from their accounts, etc. The customers can access this banks application also for viewing their account balance, getting mini statements and performing transactions as per their requirement. Simply put, this project converts the brick-and-mortar structure of traditional banking system into a click and portal model, there by giving the concept of virtual banking a real shape in true sense.

The inspiration for this ATM Simulator project stems from the basic need of having an e-financial application in todays fast paced online world, for customers in banking environment. This project is meant to nurture the needs of an end banking user by providing them various ways to perform all banking tasks at the disposal of a few button clicks. Also, to easily enable functionalities which are otherwise not provided under a conventional banking project. This project has been developed to make banking processes easy and quick, which is a shortcoming of the traditional system.

- **JCalendar Library** - `jcalendar-1.4.jar` (included in `lib/` folder)

### Quick Start (Using Makefile)

**For Linux/Mac/Git Bash (Windows):**
```bash
# 1. Setup database
mysql -u root -p < sql/bank_management_system.sql

# 2. Configure database connection
# Edit src/atm/simulator/system/Conn.java and update username/password

# 3. Run the application
make run
```

**For Windows (Using Batch Script):**
```bash
# 1. Setup database in MySQL Workbench
# Run sql/bank_management_system.sql

# 2. Configure database connection
# Edit src\atm\simulator\system\Conn.java

# 3. Run the application
compile_and_run.bat
```

### Detailed Setup Steps

1. **Clone or Download the Project**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd bankManagementSystem-main
   ```

2. **Setup MySQL Database**
   - Open MySQL Workbench or MySQL command line
   - Run the SQL script: `sql/bank_management_system.sql`
   - This creates the database `bank_management_system` and all required tables

3. **Configure Database Connection**
   - Open `src/atm/simulator/system/Conn.java`
   - Update MySQL credentials:
     ```java
     String username = "root";  // Your MySQL username
     String password = "your_password";  // Your MySQL password
     ```

4. **Verify Dependencies**
   - Check that `lib/mysql-connector-java-8.0.28.jar` exists
   - Check that `lib/jcalendar-1.4.jar` exists
   - If missing, download and place them in the `lib/` folder

5. **Compile and Run**
   
   **Option A: Using Makefile (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   make run          # Compile and run
   make compile      # Just compile
   make clean        # Clean compiled files
   make help         # Show all commands
   ```
   
   **Option B: Using Batch Script (Windows)**
   - Double-click `compile_and_run.bat`
   
   **Option C: Manual Compilation**
   ```bash
   # Compile
   javac -cp "src:lib/mysql-connector-java-8.0.28.jar:lib/jcalendar-1.4.jar" -d src src/atm/simulator/system/*.java
   
   # Run
   java -cp "src:lib/mysql-connector-java-8.0.28.jar:lib/jcalendar-1.4.jar:src/icons" atm.simulator.system.Login
